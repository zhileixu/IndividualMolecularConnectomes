# Overview
This repository provides code to reproduce the findings of the article entitled "Mapping Individual Molecular Connectomes in Alzheimer’s Disease" by Xu et al.

# System Requirements

## Software requirements
All MATLAB scripts were developed on MATLAB R2023a (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). All R scripts were developed on R 4.2.1 (https://www.r-project.org) with XGBoost package v1.7.5.1 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost). No specific operating system is required for runing these scripts.

## Dependencies and Installation
Expcept for MATLAB and R, the only required installation is the XGBoost package, which usually takes less than three mins on a normal desktop computer. Besides, the processed AHBA data and the Human Pathway Gene Sets gmt file should be downloaded and put into corresponding folders (see bellow).

# Description of each folder

## AHBAprocessed Folder:

Please download the processed AHBA data ROIxGene_aparcaseg_RNAseq.mat file from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6852911, and put it in this folder.

## Code Folder:

MATLAB and R scripts used to reproduce the findings of the article. Main findings of the article can be reproduced by runing the scripts from Step1 to Step9. A demo runing of these scripts (only one repetition in classification and prediction ananlysis) usually takes less than two hours on a normal desktop computer.

## ConnectomeClassification Folder:

The TauConnectomeContribution.mat file contains each connection’s contribution to the discrimination of three diagnostic groups using individual tau connectome.

## ConnectomeTranscriptome Folder:

The ContributionTau.mat file contains each gene’s contribution to predicting the susceptibilities of individual tau connectome.

## GSEA Folder:

Please download the Human Pathway Gene Sets gmt file from http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/, and put it in this folder.

## IndividualTauConnectome_ADNI Folder:

TRUE Individual Tau Connectome generated by the script Step1_GetIndividualMolecularConnectome.m using TRUE Tau-PET data from ADNI.

## NullPETData Folder:

NULL PET data used to test the code.

## PredefinedStagingModels Folder:

Composite brain region label of predifined staging models provided by previous studies.
